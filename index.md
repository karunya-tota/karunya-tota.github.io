Hello ðŸ‘‹ ! I'm a Software Engineer at **[Panorama Education](https://www.panoramaed.com/)**, an K-12 ed-tech company focused on improving student outcomes through its **[SEL](https://casel.org/what-is-sel/)** surveys platform and **[college & career readiness tools](https://www.panoramaed.com/student-success)**. I'm currently working on the Assessments team to build data integration tools to drive delivery and enable sales at our organization. Previously, I've interned at Yelp and Goldman Sachs.

I recieved my B.S. in Computer Science from the **[University of Illinois](https://illinois.edu/)** in 2018. Go Illini! In Fall 2017, I had the pleasure of participating in an engineering exchange program at **[Ã‰cole polytechnique fÃ©dÃ©rale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)**.

My interests span _e_-Learning platforms, personal finance management, **[learnable programming](http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/)**, public transit, building **[tools for thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/)**, and mindfulness.
